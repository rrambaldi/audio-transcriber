rem  audio-transcriber - measure the same recording on every device this
rem  machine has, in one go
rem
rem      diagnose.cmd
rem      diagnose.cmd .local\summary\gold.srt
rem      diagnose.cmd .local\summary\gold.srt .local\summary
rem
rem  It pulls, finds whichever builds of llama-server are installed, asks each
rem  one what it can see, and then makes the measurements of the round: the
rem  same recording, summarised once per thing being tried.
rem
rem  The list of runs is the block marked "the runs this round", and it is
rem  meant to be edited between rounds. The rule it exists to enforce: between
rem  two runs exactly one thing changes, or the two cannot be compared.
rem
rem  Each run leaves two files. "<name>.numbers.json" is numbers and nothing
rem  else, safe to send to anybody; "<name>.page.md" is the summary itself and
rem  stays with the transcript it was made from.
rem
rem  Where the builds are looked for: C:\llama\*vulkan*\llama-server.exe and
rem  C:\llama\*openvino*\llama-server.exe. Somewhere else:
rem
rem      set AT_LLAMA_DIR=D:\tools\llama
rem      set AT_LLAMA_VULKAN=D:\tools\llama\b1234\llama-server.exe
rem
rem  A build that is not there is reported and skipped rather than failing the
rem  run: one device measured is worth more than three not measured.
rem
rem  The control flow is flat and the runs go through a subroutine, because
rem  cmd parses the parentheses in a device description as block delimiters.

rem still look like the ones in docs/summary.md, and the page to read.

rem between them. Everything above this line stays as it is.

echo        exist, or this shell has never been initialised for conda.
